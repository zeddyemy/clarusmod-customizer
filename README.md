### Customization

- Clarusmod comes with built in custom controls, and with it, you can change the style or functionality of your wordpress theme and see the changes in real time.
- So far, here are the custom controls I have added:
    - Toggle Switch Custom Control - Creates a toggle Switch you can use to disable or enable settings.
    - TinyMce Custom Control - Creates a rich Text Editor using the TinyMCE Textarea.
    - URL Custom Control - Creates an input field specifically for URLs.
    - Plain Text Custom Control - It just displays a plain text in the customizer and doesn't do anything. Can be used to give more information.
    - Select Boxicons Custom Control - Creates a dropdown of icons allowing users to select an icon of their choice.
    - Select Category Custom Control - Creates a dropdown of all the categories present on the wordpress site.

## Built With

- At the Moment, this theme uses only the Boxicons library to display icons the site. There is also a custom control that utilizes the library to allow users select from the list of available Icons.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the work of many talented developers. While I was unable to find the original source of the CSS file that helped me change the default look of the WordPress Customizer side panel, I would like to extend my gratitude to all those who have contributed to the WordPress community and shared their knowledge and expertise. Your work has been a great source of inspiration for me and has helped me create this project. Thank you!
