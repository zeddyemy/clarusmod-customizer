### Customization

Clarusmod comes with built in custom controls, and with it, you can change the style or functionality of your wordpress theme and see the changes in real time.
- So far, here are the custom controls I have added:
    - Toggle Switch Custom Control - Creates a toggle Switch you can use to disable or enable settings.
    - TinyMce Custom Control - Creates a rich Text Editor using the TinyMCE Textarea.
    - URL Custom Control - Creates an input field specifically for URLs.
    - Plain Text Custom Control - It just displays a plain text in the customizer and doesn't do anything. Can be used to give more information.
    - Select Boxicons Custom Control - Creates a dropdown of icons allowing users to select an icon of their choice.
    - Select Category Custom Control - Creates a dropdown of all the categories present on the wordpress site.
    - Searchable Select Custom Control - Creates a dropdown of options and has search functionality.

## Built With

- Boxicons library: This theme uses only the Boxicons library to display icons the site. There is also a [custom control that utilizes the library](https://github.com/zeddyemy/clarusmod-customizer/blob/main/inc/customizer/customizer-extensions/custom-controls/class-boxicon-select-custom-control.php#L14) to allow users select from the list of available Icons.
- Select2 Library: The Select2 Library is used to for the Searchable Select Custom Control. It's what enables the search functionality for a select field.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the work of many talented developers. While I was unable to find the original source of the CSS file that helped me change the default look of the WordPress Customizer side panel, I would like to extend my gratitude to all those who have contributed to the WordPress community and shared their knowledge and expertise. Your work has been a great source of inspiration for me and has helped me create this project. Thank you!

Additionally, I took inspiration from the work of OriginalEXE on GitHub for extending panels and sections to allow nesting. Their Gist provided valuable insights that helped in developing the custom panel section of this theme. You can find the Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/OriginalEXE/9a6183e09f4cae2f30b006232bb154af).
